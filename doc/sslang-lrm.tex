\section{Documentation Conventions}

In the grammar that follows, literal terminals are printed \lit*{bold
  mono spaced}.  Syntactic categories are written in \<italics>.
Normal parentheses () are used for grouping, superscripts represent
$^*$ zero or more and $^+$ one or more, and square brackets []
indicate character ranges, e.g., [\lit*{A}--\lit*{Z}] indicates all
uppercase letters.

\section{Lexical Conventions}

\subsection{Comments}

Single line comments start with \lit*{//} and end at a newline.

Multi-line comments start with \lit*{/*} and end at a matching
\lit*{*/}.  Multi-line comments nest and may also include
single-line comments.

\subsection{Layout}

For brevity, sslang allows the programmer to selectively omit braces \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}} as well as certain separator tokens, and instead convey the same information using \emph{layout} (indentation). Layout-sensitive and layout-insensitive syntax are both supported and mutually compatible, so the meaning of a layout-sensitive program can always specified by adding braces and tokens to produce some equivalent layout-insensitive program. This section describes the procedure by which those tokens are inserted.

Sslang's syntax contains \emph{blocks} surrounded by brace tokens \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}}. Blocks consist of other syntactic items separated by some \emph{separator} token.

\subsubsection{Implicit Blocks}

Items in sslang's syntax that are surrounded by braces are called \emph{blocks}, and the enclosed items of a block are delimited by some \emph{separator} token (e.g., \texttt{;}). We call blocks whose tokens are inserted by the scanner \emph{implicit} blocks.

In an implicit block, items all share the same indentation; visually, they are vertically aligned. The scanner treats lines with greater indentation (that are not part of an inner block) as part of the previous item; these are called \emph{line continuations}. When the scanner comes across lines with less indentation, an implicit block is ended.

For instance, a user may write:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop
  f x
    y
  g x
h x
\end{lstlisting}

The scanner transforms this input into:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop
  { f x y
  ; g x
  }
; h x
\end{lstlisting}

Implicit blocks are started after \emph{layout} keywords, which come in two flavors: \emph{layout-next-token} keywords, which start blocks at the next token, and \emph{layout-next-line} keywords, which start blocks on the following line.

An example of a layout-next-line keyword is \texttt{if}:

\begin{lstlisting}
if f x
  g x
  g y
\end{lstlisting}

which is expanded to:

\begin{lstlisting}
if f x
  { g x
  ; g y
  }
\end{lstlisting}

A special layout-next-token that behaves slightly differently than those above is \texttt{do} (whose separator is \texttt{;}). If the scanner comes across \texttt{do} token when it would have otherwise started a block on the next line, the scanner instead \emph{replaces} the \texttt{do} with a \texttt{\{}, and immediately starts an implicit block at the next token.

This allows the programmer to write:

\begin{lstlisting}
if f x do g x
\end{lstlisting}

Which will be expanded to:

\begin{lstlisting}
if f x { g x }
\end{lstlisting}

In any other case, \texttt{do} behaves like a regular layout-next-token, and is used to start implicit blocks. For instance:

\begin{lstlisting}
f x do g y
       g x
\end{lstlisting}

Is expanded to:

\begin{lstlisting}
f x do { g y
       ; g x
       }
\end{lstlisting}

Sslang recognizes the following layout-next-token keywords:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{loop} with \texttt{;} separating sequenced expressions
  \item \texttt{=} with \texttt{;} separating sequenced expressions
  \item \texttt{<-} with \texttt{;} separating sequenced expression
  \item \texttt{else} with \texttt{;} separating sequenced expression
  \item \texttt{wait} with \texttt{||} separating sensitized scheduled variables
  \item \texttt{par} with \texttt{||} separating parallel expressions
  \item \texttt{let} with \texttt{||} separating mutually recursive definitions
\end{itemize}

And the following layout-next-line keywords:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{if} with \texttt{;} separating sequenced expressions
  \item \texttt{while} with \texttt{;} separating sequenced expressions
  \item \texttt{match} with \texttt{|} separating match arms
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Explicit Blocks}

Programmers may also choose to write braces and separators anyway, where allowed by the syntax; these blocks are called \emph{explicit} blocks. Writing explicit blocks effectively turns off the scanner's token insertion for that block (though inner implicit blocks may still be created).

For instance, if the user writes:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop {
  f x;
  wait x
       y
}
\end{lstlisting}

The scanner transforms this into the following token stream:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop {
  f x;
  wait {  x
       || y
       }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Inside of an explicit block, the scanner does not insert separators and ignores indentation (unless an inner block is started). So the following is legal:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop
  loop {
f x
;
g y
}
h z
\end{lstlisting}

And is expanded into the following

\begin{lstlisting}
loop {
  loop {
    f x ;
    g y
  }
};
h z
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Delimited Expressions}

In addition to the braces \texttt{\{\}}, which delimit blocks, sslang also includes other matched delimiters: \texttt{[]} and \texttt{()}. To ensure that any program with matched delimiters remains correctly matched after token insertion, the scanner also keeps track of these delimiter pairs. In particular, if it comes across an explicit closing delimiter, it closes all implicit blocks opened since the corresponding opening delimiter, even if indentation would not have otherwise caused it to do so.

For instance, the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
(loop
   wait x)
\end{lstlisting}

Is expanded as:

\begin{lstlisting}
(loop
  { wait {x}})
\end{lstlisting}

Rather than:

\begin{lstlisting}
(loop
  { (wait {x)}
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Note, however, that it makes no such consideration for separator tokens. So the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop
  wait x;
  f x
\end{lstlisting}

is expanded into:

\begin{lstlisting}
loop
  { wait {x;}
  ; f x
  }
\end{lstlisting}

which the parser shall deem a syntax error.

\begin{lstlisting}
TODO: turn this into \algorithm or at least something that doesn't look like some text adventure game

What kind of token?

> newline

  About to start new block?

  > yes

    What is the indentation level of the next non-whitespace token?

    > equal to or less than previous block

      Error: block indentation level must be greater than before.

    > greater than previous block

      What is the next non-whitespace token?

      > '{'

        Scan past that next '{', and start explicit block there.

        Insert '}' to end implicit block.

      > same as implicit block

        Insert separator, continue implicit block.

      > greater than implicit block

        Continue (treated as continuation).

      > greater than block

        Continue (treated as continuation).

    Emit 'do', and try to start a new block with ';' on next token.

> layout token (e.g., 'loop', '=', 'wait')

  Emit token, and try to start a new block with appropriate separator on next token.

> layoutNL token (e.g., 'if', 'while')

  Emit token, and try to start a new block at the next line of the current block.

> '{'

  About to start new block?

  > yes

    Emit '{' to start explicit block at this column.

  > no

    Emit '{' to start explicit block at this column (probably an error, but let that be handled by parser (?)).

> '[' or '('

  About to start new block?

  > yes

    Insert '{' to start implicit block at this column, before emitting this token to start its explicit block.

  > no

    Emit this token to start its explicit block.

> '}' ']' or ')'

  Can the most recent explicit block/delimited expression (if any) be closed by this token?

  > yes

    Insert enough '}' tokens to close all implicit blocks, before emitting this token to close most recent explicit block.

  > no

    Error: mismatched right delimiter.

> anything else

  Emit token.

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{User-defined operators}

The parser naively parses every compound expression into a flat list of atomic
expression terminals. A later stage of the compiler uses the declared operator
precedences and reassembles the AST into a tree.

\fixme{Avoid Coq's mess of scope declarations and accompanying plumbing; take
a look at Agda's user-defined operators.}

\section{Types}

\setlength{\grammarindent}{6em}
\begin{grammar}
<type> ::= <type-app> "->" <type>
\alt <type-app>

<type-app> ::= <type-app> <type-atom>
\alt <type-atom>

<type-pre> ::= "&" <type-pre>
\alt <type-atom>

<type-atom> ::= <type-id>
\alt "(" ")"
\alt "[" <type> "]"
\alt "(" <type> ("," <type>)$^*$ ")"

<type-id> ::= ["A"--"Z"]["a"--"zA"--"Z0"--"9"]$^*$
\end{grammar}

\fixme{What about type variables?  Are we going to use OCaml-style \texttt{'a}
  or just leave them as type-ids?}

Type names start with a capital letter followed by zero or more
letters and digits.

A type of the form \<type>$_1$ \lit*{->} \<type>$_2$ represents a function
from \<type>$_1$ to \<type>$_2$. Also, \lit*{->} groups
right-to-left, e.g.,
\lit*{Int} \lit*{->} \lit*{Int} \lit*{->} \lit*{Int}
means
\lit*{Int} \lit*{->} \lit*{(} \lit*{Int} \lit*{->} \lit*{Int} \lit*{)}.

Types may be polymorphic and take one or more types as arguments.
Type argument application is denoted by juxtaposition and groups
left-to-right, e.g.,
\lit*{Either} \lit*{Int} \lit*{Char}
means
\lit*{(} \lit*{Either} \lit*{Int} \lit*{)} \lit*{Char}.

Parentheses provide a way to override precedence; empty parentheses
\lit*{()} denote the ``unit'' type.

A type in square brackets indicates a list of that type, e.g.,
\lit*{[} \lit*{Int} \lit*{]} is a list of integers.

An ampersand \lit*{\&} before a type indicates a reference to that type.

\fixme{Is this a mutable reference, or is that something different?}

A parentheses-enclosed comma-separated list of two or more types
denotes a tuple, e.g., \lit*{(} \lit*{Int} \lit*{,} \lit*{Int}
\lit*{)} is a pair of integers.

\section{Top-Level Definitions}
Top-level definitions in sslang consistent of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identifier name (global variable or routine name)
    \item Zero or more patterns, possibly type-annotated
    \item Annotated return type
    \item Body
\end{itemize}
The compiler will perform type inference for untyped components and will verify that typed components are correct.

\subsection{Type Signatures}
At the core of sslang type signatures, we have two symbols that provide type information about a language construct. Their meanings are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{:} (Colon): ``is of type"
    \item \texttt{->} (Right Arrow): ``returns"
\end{itemize}

We use these symbols to separate type signatures into two broad syntactic categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{foo <params> -> <ret-type>}\\
          Using the ``\texttt{->}" syntax, the return type of the routine is denoted at the end of the signature. This is evocative of languages like Python and Rust.
    \item \texttt{foo <untyped-params> : <fn-type>}\\
          Using the ``\texttt{:}" syntax, we opt for annotating the type of the entire routine at the end of the signature instead of typing the parameters individually and the return type separately. This is evocative of Haskell's type signatures. If no parameters are specified, the definition is interpreted as a global variable.
\end{itemize}

When annotating parameters, sslang uses the ``\texttt{:}" syntax to specify the type of a parameter. sslang also supports distributing type annotations over tuple members. As such, the following two type annotations are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{(a: Int, b: Bool)}
    \item \texttt{(a , b) : (Int, Bool)}
\end{itemize}

While we support these two styles of tuple type annotation, only one form may be used. All identifiers must be type annotated at most once. \\

Top-level definitions can be summarized by the following grammar. Note that parameters may be specified using pattern syntax (\texttt{_} as wildcard, \texttt{()} as unit) and that type annotations may only appear on patterns within parentheses.
\setlength{\grammarindent}{9em}
\begin{grammar}
<def_let> ::= <pat>$^{+}$ <typ_fn> "= \{" <body> "\}"

<typ_fn> ::= "->" <type>
\alt ":" <type>

<pat> ::= "id @" <pat>
\alt <pat_atomic>

<pat_atomic> ::= "id"
\alt "_"
\alt "()"
\alt "(" <pat_ann> ("," <pat_ann>)$^{*}$ ")"

<pat_ann> ::= <pat> ":" <typ>$^{?}$
\end{grammar}

\section{Wish List}

\subsection{Philosphy}

\textit{SE:} Make the IR, especially, as simple as possible (a la
GHC). Take a Reynolds-like approach where the larger language has more
features that boil down into simpler primitives.  E.g., typeclasses
can be expressed as dictionaries with function pointers and completely
evaporate.  I'm inspired by the make-it-explicit approach to garbage
collection operations in the Perceus tech report (Reinking et al.,
MSR-TR-2020-42).

\subsection{Syntax}

\textit{SE:} Minimal punctuation (e.g., print ``hello'' vs. print(``hello'')).
\textit{JH:} I would like to have punctuation for types/operations with special
built-in meaning, e.g., \verb|&| or \verb|*| for references. I'm not opposed to
using parens for function application, but it depends on whether we can have
partial application.

\textit{SE, JH:} Nested comments

\textit{JH:} Single-line comment syntax. I think this makes sense especially for
a whitespace-sensitive language.

\textit{SE, JH:} Indentation-sensitive nesting; keywords start blocks (Haskell-style).

\textit{SE, JH:} User-defined binary operators and precedence levels.

\textit{JH:} User-defined type-level operator definitions. e.g., \verb|$| for
avoiding parens in type application, \verb|&| for ref.

\textit{JH:} some kind of readable, forward-thinking syntax for annotations that
the compiler can take advantage of, e.g., must-inline, dont-inline,
stack-allocate, maybe-unused. Should be less hacky than Haskell's
\verb|{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}| and C/C++'s \verb|#pragma ..| and
\verb|__attribute__((..))|.

\textit{SE:} C\# has an elaborate attributes mechanism.
Most declarations allow attributes to be placed in square brackets before.  \url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/}

\begin{lstlisting}{language=[Sharp]C}
  
[Serializable]
public class SampleClass
{
    // Objects of this type can be serialized.
} 
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Discussions}

\subsection{Types and expressions}

\textit{SE, JH:} Type expressions.

\textit{SE, JH:} Algebraic data types + pattern-matching.

Statically sized arrays passable through abstract array arguments, e.g., so you
can write a sort that's polymorphic in the size of the array; implies array size
is a runtime value, not (just) compile-time.

\textit{SE, JH:} Typeclasses at least for arithmetic operators

Pass-by-value and pass-by-reference values

\textit{JH:} References to arrays of T, arrays of arrays of T

\textit{JH, SE:} Array slices (``safe'' references to parts of arrays that play
well with parallelism)

\textit{SE, JH:} Type inference at least for local variables

\textit{JH:} Type annotations for function arguments

\textit{SE, JH:} Parametric polymorphism, likely eliminated by whole-program
monomorphisation (type variables)

\textit{SE, JH:} A notion of constants (assign once) versus variables (assign
multiple times)

\textit{JH:} a notion of ownership that users can opt into (which reduces to
reference-sharing otherwise).

\subsubsection{Discussions}

Partial application?  Or do we prohibit it?

\subsection{Control flow}

\textit{SE, JH:} Parallel function calls.

\textit{SE, JH:} Wait on variables

\textit{SE, JH:} Immediate and delayed assignment ``primitives''.

\textit{JH:} Some sort of exception handling, which supports missed deadlines.

\textit{SE, JH:} combinators to derive "wait until" and "wait both" and "wait either".

\subsection{Compilation and generated code}

\textit{SE, JH:} Compile-time allocation of all data (exception: activation records)

\textit{SE, JH:} Facility for efficient code generation with compile-time
constants (should this be syntactically different?).

\textit{JH:} provide some FFI that supports callback, to interface with both
blocking and non-blocking functions.

\textit{JH:} provide some kind of immediately effectful print statement.

\textit{SE:} No need for separate compilation, just do whole-program
compilation. This makes monomorphisation straightforward/simple.

\subsection{IR}

\begin{itemize}
\item Variables and literals
\item Lambda abstractions
\item Function application
\item Pattern matching
